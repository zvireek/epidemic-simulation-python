# Epidemic Simulation (Python OOP Project)

A graphical application that simulates the spread of an epidemic in a population, divided into age groups.  
This project was developed as a final assignment for the **Programming 2 (Python)** course and demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming**, **Tkinter (GUI)**, and **matplotlib** for real-time data visualization.

## üöÄ Features
- Simulation of a population divided into adjustable size age groups (young, adults, elderly).  
- Adjustable epidemic parameters:
  - disease name,  
  - transmission rate,  
  - incubation period,  
  - infectious period.  
- Option to enable/disable **social distancing**.  
- Dynamic real-time chart showing the epidemic course (Susceptible / Infected / Recovered).  
- Reset and restart functionality.
